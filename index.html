      <h3>Thinking Like a Programmer</h3>
      There are 5 main types of thinking that are frequently used by programmers:
      <div>
        <ol>
        <li><em>Procedural</em><br>
        Involves creating clear and concise instructions for a computer to follow.</li>
        <li><em>Abstract</em><br>
        Involves finding ways to improve programming efficiency by helping avoid<br>
        unnecessary repetition of work.</li>
        <li><em>Systems</em><br>
        Involves breaking down large problems into smaller problems and recognizing<br>
        how those individual pieces fit together.</li>
        <li><em>Technological Empathy</em><br>
        Involves understanding how computers work and what they are good<br>
        and bad at and using that knowledge to your advantage while coding.
        <li><em>Debugging</em><br>
        Involves using a system to make identifying and fixing bugs quick<br>
        and relatively easy.</li>
        </ol>

        <dt><em>The World Wide Web</em></dt>
        <dd>A network of servers and other computers on which<br>
        HTML documents and files are hosted and accessed.</dd>
      </div>
      <div>
        <dt><em>Components of the WWW</em></dt>
        <dd>-Users who use computers to access and create content on the WWW.<br>
          -Computers which run programs (browsers) that display pages and files found<br>
          on the web.<br>
          -The Internet which is the largest network of computers in the world.<br>
          -Servers which are computers that host the files that make up the web.<br>
          -HTTP which is the protocol that is used to communicate between these<br>
          components. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">This Wikipedia
          entry</a> explains HyperText Transfer Protocol in<br>
          extreme depth.</dd>

        <div>
          <dt><em>Webpages</em></dt>
          <dd>Text documents, written in HTML, which are read, interpreted, and displayed<br>
          by web browsers.</dd>
        </div>
        <div>
          <dt><em>HTML</em></dt>
          <dd>HyperText Markup Language is a programming language which is the basis of<br>
          almost every webpage on the WWW. HTML documents consist of:<br>
          -Text content (what you see)<br>
          -Markup (how it looks)<br>
          -References to other documents/files (images, video, audio, other pages, etc.<br>
          (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fS7w-TXinPE">This video</a> is an excellent 
          introduction to HTML.)</dd>

          <dt><em>Components of HTML</em></dt>
          <dd>-Tags: The text instructions that tell a browser how to display content.<br>
          They are always contained within angled braces. They're paired together with<br>
          an opening and closing tag, except for void tags.<br>
          -Elements: A unit made up of a tag and the content it affects, or an opening and<br>
          closing tag and the content between them.<br></dd>
        </div>
        <div>
          <dt><em>Inline vs Block Tags</em></dt>
          <dd>The two types of tags within HTML are inline and block tags. Block tags form<br>
          a box around the contents wihin them.</dd>
        </div>
        <div>
          <dt><em>Coding</em></dt>
          <dd>The action of writing text instructions in a language that computers can<br>
          understand and follow.</dd>

          <dt><em>Correct <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/syntax">Syntax</a></em></dt>
          <dd>Computers are "stupid" because they require code to be written<br>
          in a very exact way to be able to understand it. Humans are considered "smart," by<br>
          contrast, because they are capable of compensating for and overcoming typos.</dd>

        <h3>Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h3>
        <dl>
        <div>
          <dt><em>Text Editors</em></dt>
          <dd>The programs used to write and edit the code for webpages. They are similar to<br>
          word processors like Microsoft Word, but lack the formatting functions. Good<br>
          text editors have many automatic and predictive functions that make programming<br>
          easier. They can often be used to write code in multiple languages.</dd>
        </div>
        <div>
          <dt><em>HTML vs CSS vs JavaScript</em></dt>
          <dd>-HTML is the language used to define the structure and content of a webpage.<br>
          -CSS is the language used to define the style of the webpage.<br>
          -JavaScript is the language used to define the interactive components of a webpage.</dd>
        </div>
        <div>
          <dt><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">DOM</a></em></dt>
          <dd>Document Object Model is the standard convention used in representing<br>
          and interacting with elements in HTML. This means that browsers all render<br>
          HTML using the same model, resulting in a common pattern in the structure of <br>
          all webpages (see <em>Branching Structure</em> below).</dd>
        </div>
        <div>
          <dt><em>Browser Developer Tools</em></dt>
          <dd>Add-ons or built-in features that allow you to view the DOM trees that browsers<br>
          interpret HTML documents as, and the styles applied to the elements contained with<br>
          these HTML documents.</dd>

          <dt><em>Branching Structure</em></dt>
          <dd>Because HTML elements can be nested within each other, the structure of an HTML<br>
          document can be analogized to a tree. The more deeply nested within other elements<br>
          an individual element is, the further up and out from the trunk of the tree it would<br>
          be found. For example, an image might be nested within a 'div' element which is, in<br>
          turn, nested within the 'body' element. The body may be considered the trunk of the<br>
          tree, the div, a bough sticking out from the trunk, and the image, a twig sticking out<br>
          from the bough.</dd>
        </div>
        <div>
          <dt><em>Nested Boxes and Indentation</em></dt>
          <dd>Every single visible element of a webpage is bounded by a box and, therefore,<br>
          every webpage can be broken down into a series of boxes with smaller boxes inside<br>
          of them (and often more boxes inside of these smaller boxes, and so on). Front end<br>
          web developers do this with design mockups of webpages to begin laying out the<br>
          framework of a page. Every layer of nesting around an element's box corresponds<br>
          to another level of indentation.</dd>
        </div>
        <div>
          <dt><em>Placeholder Content</em></dt>
          <dd>After creating an outline of the elements on a page and indenting each element to<br>
          the correct level, it is helpful to place text, which will help you remember what goes<br>
          where, temporarily inside most elements.</dd>
        </div>
        <div>
          <dt><em>Comments</em></dt>
          <dd>Text notes, which the browser does not read, that are included in order to<br>
          communicate with other people who will read the code or to leave reminders and<br>
          explanations about specific elements.</dd>
